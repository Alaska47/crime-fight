# This is the implementation of BigParser's API.
We use the API to get Historical Crime data to provide Analytics and insights for our users.

The initial supported region is the D.C. Metro Area.

We look forward to expanding to other areas in the U.s.


Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/vinchinzu/dc-metro-crime-data and rendered using Google Maps for the user.
