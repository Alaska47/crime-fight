CrimeFighter is a beautiful, modern, lightweight app that revolutionizes and modernizes crime reporting.

CrimeFighter has three main functionalities:

__1. Reporting a stolen item__

People can report an item missing and those in close vicinity to the crime will be alerted with a description of the object or thief. If they have seen the item or the thief, they can _Witness_ it.

_Witness_ allows users who have seen a thief or object after the crime to update the objectâ€™s location and provide additional details about the perpetrator.

Where is this useful, and why would you use this over the police?

CrimeFighter is designed for closed environments: colleges and schools. A laptop or backpack stolen inside a college or school is likely to remain inside the school. Quick, immediate, and rapid alerts increase the likelihood of finding these items. Using the power of your classmates and the cloud, CrimeFighter revolutionizes tracking small theft in real-time.
